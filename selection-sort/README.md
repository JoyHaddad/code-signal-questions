# Selection Sort Implementation

## Description

This function sorts a given array of integers using the **Selection Sort** algorithm.

- The algorithm works by selecting the smallest integer from the array and swapping it with the first position.
- This process is repeated for each subsequent position until the array is sorted.

## Example

### Input

`[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`

### Output

`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

## Time Complexity

The expected time complexity is **O(nÂ²)**.
